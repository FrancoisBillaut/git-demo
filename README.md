I have created a git repository called "git-demo" This is the first file in this repo, I will save it as README.md in the "git-demo" folder on C/OS drive

I am introducing a change to this file (I will have to do again and git add and git commit)

I am introducing a second change to this file: just a note I added index.html to my repo

hehehehehehehehe
